# Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/`)

This document describes the custom React hooks defined in the [src/hooks/](mdc:src/hooks) directory.

Custom hooks encapsulate reusable stateful logic.

## Available Hooks

*   **[usePaginationSearchParams.js](mdc:src/hooks/usePaginationSearchParams.js)**:
    *   Manages state related to pagination (e.g., current page, items per page).
    *   Likely synchronizes this state with URL search parameters (`useSearchParams` from `react-router`).
    *   Useful for components like data tables that require pagination controlled via the URL.

*   **[use-mobile.jsx](mdc:src/hooks/use-mobile.jsx)**:
    *   Detects whether the application is being viewed on a mobile-sized screen.
    *   Probably uses `window.matchMedia` or similar techniques to check screen width against a predefined breakpoint.
    *   Useful for applying responsive behavior or rendering different components based on screen size.

*   **[use-theme.jsx](mdc:src/hooks/use-theme.jsx)**:
    *   Provides an interface to interact with the application's theme context.
    *   Likely consumes the context provided by `ThemeProvider` ([src/providers/theme-provider.jsx](mdc:src/providers/theme-provider.jsx)).
    *   Allows components to access the current theme (e.g., `light` or `dark`) and potentially toggle between themes.
