# UI Components

This document describes the organization and types of UI components used in the application.

## Component Structure

Components are primarily located in the [src/components/](mdc:src/components) directory.

*   **Base UI Components (`src/components/ui/`)**: This directory ([src/components/ui/](mdc:src/components/ui)) contains the core, reusable UI elements.
    *   These components are generated and managed using **[shadcn/ui](mdc:https:/ui.shadcn.com)**.
    *   Examples include [Button](mdc:src/components/ui/button.jsx), [Input](mdc:src/components/ui/input.jsx), [Table](mdc:src/components/ui/table.jsx), [Dialog](mdc:src/components/ui/dialog.jsx), [Select](mdc:src/components/ui/select.jsx), etc.
    *   These components are built upon [Radix UI](mdc:https:/www.radix-ui.com) primitives and styled with [Tailwind CSS](mdc:https:/tailwindcss.com).
    *   The [components.json](mdc:components.json) file at the root likely contains the shadcn/ui configuration.
    *   A reusable [DataTable](mdc:src/components/ui/data-table) component is also located here.

*   **Application-Specific Components (`src/components/`)**: The root of the components directory contains higher-level components specific to this application's features.
    *   Examples include: [AppSidebar.jsx](mdc:src/components/AppSidebar.jsx), [ShipmentTrackingCard.jsx](mdc:src/components/ShipmentTrackingCard.jsx), [OverallStatusBadge.jsx](mdc:src/components/OverallStatusBadge.jsx), [FullScreenLoader.jsx](mdc:src/components/FullScreenLoader.jsx).
    *   Subdirectories like `Modals/` and `Sidebar/` group related composite components.

## Usage

*   Base UI components from `src/components/ui/` are imported and composed to build application-specific components and page layouts.
*   Application-specific components are typically used within pages ([src/pages/](mdc:src/pages)) or layouts ([src/layouts/](mdc:src/layouts)).
